My name is Rongjun Geng. I'm a software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Beijing, China, but I moved to San Francisco Bay Area in 2017.
I love all foods, particularly French food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
